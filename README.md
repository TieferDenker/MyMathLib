# Project Title

All pure as well as applied mathematics related codes implemented in Python programming language

## Description

This repository contains all the math functions that I feel are widely used in the programming world (especially competitive programming), which include elementary number theortic functions, analytic number theortic functions, combinatorial functions, data compression algorithms, error correction codes, and many more (which I'll include later).

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Use windows 10 or above and python 3 or above

### Installing

Just import math and get started with it!!!

### Executing program

Just run the code (which is basically a Python script (".py" files)) in the terminal from the command line using the command:  
py script_name.py

## Help

Feel free to contact me in case you face any problem while running the code or if you get a better technique/algo (which I'm sure you surely will).  
The problems which I'm not able to solve are left to the coders as an exercise!
